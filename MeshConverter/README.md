# Multimedia Retrieval Project - Database Pre-Processing
This sub-project handles the preprocessing of the databases.

## Build Requirements
For mesh pre-processing and plotting figures `Python 3` is used. It is possible to use [Python Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to keep the libraries contained to this project.

The required packages are listed below, but can also be found in `scripts/requirements.pip` and `MeshConverter/requirements.pip`. These requirement files can be used to install all packages at once with the following command:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.pip
```
